# Cross-Channel Discord Agent


Create a Discord `AI Agent` that monitors multiple Discord channels. When the agent detects signals related to subscribed topics, it will react accordingly.

## Project Structure

- [Database/](./Database/) - Core database implementations and configurations
- [Database/readme.md](./Database/readme.md) - Database schema design and entity relationships
- [DiscordData/readme.md](./DiscrodData/readme.md) - Discord bot implementation details and setup guide


## Scenario

A team behind the “XX” protocol wants to monitor various Discord channels to stay informed about discussions related to their protocol (or coin ?).


Discord indexer modal -  will periodically download data from all pre-selected Discord channels. The conversation text with specific parameters will be indexed in a vector store to facilitate quick and relevant searches.

The agent will query the vector store using vector search to identify new mentions or questions related to the subscribed topics. if a discussion about the protocol appears in any of the channels, the agent will immediately respond based on its pre-prepared knowledge base (which may be fine-tuned or vector-based for Q&A).

Fallback Process: If the agent cannot find an appropriate answer, it will record the unresolved query and report it to the owner for further review.

**Reporting:**

The agent can provide daily and monthly summarized reports that include:

- Mentions of the protocol
- Sentiment analysis
- Identified problems or issues

This helps protocol owners and users, as well as potential users, stay informed and identify hidden problems or scams through built-in detection mechanisms.

**Channel Choice:**

Discord was chosen as the initial platform due to its popularity as a communication channel. In the future, additional channels may be integrated.

**Future Integrations:**

After the initial iterations, there are plans to integrate GitHub repositories that will be technically connected to user support systems.

**Economic Mechanism**

The infrastructure provider (referred to as “The Agent Farm Runner”) can invest in the necessary infrastructure—including servers, the vector store, and AI API expenses (such as embedding generation). They will then set the market price for bot usage based on these costs.

The Agent can recive the payment and generate invocie

####  Expand Platform Support:

Consider integrating other popular communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Telegram, or Microsoft Teams) to broaden the agent’s utility.

**User Feedback Loop:**

Implement a feedback system where protocol owners can mark responses as helpful or flag unresolved queries, enabling iterative improvements to the agent’s knowledge base.
